Small-instance benchmark
========================

`scripts/benchmark_small_instance.sh` measures a ten-user Eunha instance with
fresh PostgreSQL data and a namespaced Redis keyspace. It runs a read-heavy mix
of home/public timelines, notifications and account reads, with 5% status
writes. Every pool-size case uses a separate temporary database, which is
removed on exit.

Run a representative burst:

~~~~ sh
mise exec -- env EUNHA_BENCH_SECONDS=30 \
  EUNHA_BENCH_CONCURRENCY=8 \
  EUNHA_BENCH_POOLS="1 2 3 5" \
  scripts/benchmark_small_instance.sh
~~~~

The script requires a local PostgreSQL server, Redis on database 14, Node.js,
and a current `target/release/eunha`. Results are written below
`benchmark-results/`, which is ignored by Git.


2026-09-09 baseline
-------------------

Measured on an Apple Silicon Mac17,2 with 10 CPU cores and 24 GiB RAM, using
PostgreSQL 18 (`shared_buffers=160 MiB`, `work_mem=4 MiB`) and eight concurrent
clients for 20 seconds:

| Pool |  Idle RSS |  Peak RSS | Avg CPU | Peak active DB | Requests/s |      p95 | Errors |
| ---: | --------: | --------: | ------: | -------------: | ---------: | -------: | -----: |
|    1 | 32.64 MiB | 61.81 MiB |  59.52% |              1 |   1,017.95 | 13.87 ms |      0 |
|    2 | 32.16 MiB | 65.23 MiB |  98.03% |              1 |   1,776.00 |  7.19 ms |      0 |
|    3 | 32.70 MiB | 66.09 MiB | 127.40% |              2 |   2,131.05 |  6.42 ms |      0 |
|    5 | 32.78 MiB | 67.45 MiB | 152.64% |              2 |   2,144.55 |  6.74 ms |      0 |

At two concurrent clients, one, two and three connections delivered 758.75,
783.35 and 774.30 requests/s respectively, all without errors. Peak Eunha RSS
was 43.88–45.16 MiB.

This is an intentionally hot local API benchmark, not a federation or media
benchmark. It establishes the per-process baseline and connection-pool knee; a
production sizing exercise must additionally replay real federation ingress,
media uploads, network latency and retained data.


Hosting recommendation
----------------------

For a small, roughly ten-person hosted instance, start with:

~~~~ toml
[database_pool]
max_connections = 2
min_connections = 0
acquire_timeout_seconds = 5
idle_timeout_seconds = 20

[workers]
queue_idle_poll_seconds = 300
~~~~

and `TOKIO_WORKER_THREADS=2` in the process environment.

Two connections were effectively identical to larger pools at ordinary
concurrency and retained most of the throughput at the deliberately excessive
eight-client load. Three is a reasonable promotion tier for a busy tenant;
five showed no material throughput benefit in this run. The idle timeout,
queue poll and worker threads come from the density measurements below, where
they cut an idle tenant's PostgreSQL memory by about five times and its threads
by three.

Budget PostgreSQL slots at the host level instead of multiplying its setting
until every tenant's theoretical pool maximum fits. Reserve slots for
operations and migrations, and enforce an admission budget such as:

~~~~ text
tenant slots = max_connections - superuser_reserved_connections
               - reserved_connections - operational headroom
~~~~

For example, `max_connections=200`, three superuser-reserved slots and 17
operational slots leave 180 tenant slots: 90 two-connection small instances,
before accounting for any dedicated large tenants. Do not plan to run at that
absolute edge; a 70–80% steady-state slot target leaves room for migrations,
failover and load movement.

Raising `max_connections` consumes PostgreSQL shared resources even while
connections are idle. `work_mem` is more dangerous: it applies per query
operation, and parallel workers can multiply it. On a 32 GiB host, 200 is a
conservative first ceiling with modest `work_mem`, measured under the actual
query mix; raising it further should follow load testing and memory telemetry,
not tenant count alone.

For substantially more small tenants, put PgBouncer in transaction pooling
mode between Eunha and PostgreSQL, cap pools per database/user, and verify its
prepared-statement configuration with SQLx. Keep mega instances on dedicated
PostgreSQL pools or hosts so they cannot consume the small-tenant connection
and memory budget.

Tenants per host
================

The small-instance benchmark measures one process. A hosting service needs the
other number: how many tenants one machine carries. That is mostly decided by
what tenants cost while nobody is using them, which one process under load
cannot show.

`scripts/benchmark_density.sh` answers it. It brings up a PostgreSQL cluster
and Redis server of its own, starts tenants in steps — one eunha process and
one database each, configured as recommended above — and at each step records
the population's idle cost and then its latency under an open-loop request
load spread across every tenant. At the end it restarts a burst of tenants at
once, which is what waking dormant tenants looks like.

~~~~ sh
mise exec -- env EUNHA_DENSITY_COUNTS="10 100 300" \
  EUNHA_DENSITY_LOAD_RPS="200 800" \
  scripts/benchmark_density.sh
~~~~

Every knob is an `EUNHA_DENSITY_*` variable at the top of the script, which
also records the traps that make naive measurements wrong. Two matter when
reading any number here:

 -  **Memory is phys\_footprint, not RSS.** RSS counts the binary's text once
    per process although all of them share it. A tenant's real cost is less
    than half its RSS.
 -  **PostgreSQL connections are costed privately.** Every backend's footprint
    repeats the shared buffer pages it has touched; the script subtracts that
    mapping and adds `shared_buffers` once.


2026-09-11 baseline
-------------------

Measured on the same Mac17,2 (10 cores, 24 GiB), PostgreSQL 18 with
`shared_buffers=1GB`, tenants with a two-connection pool and a 60-second idle
timeout. The machine was also a developer's workstation with most of its
memory already in use, which matters at the top of the range.

What one idle tenant costs, constant from 10 to 300 tenants:

| Resource                             |                  Per idle tenant |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------: |
| eunha footprint, never served load   |                        14–18 MiB |
| eunha footprint after serving load   |                        37–40 MiB |
| Threads                              |                               12 |
| PostgreSQL connections held          |                                2 |
| PostgreSQL private memory            | 9.6 MiB (4.8 MiB per connection) |
| Transactions while idle              |                            3.1/s |
| CPU while idle, eunha and PostgreSQL |                0.09% of one core |
| Empty database on disk               |                         15.3 MiB |

Two of those are not what the tenancy plan assumed. A “zero minimum” pool
never reached zero: the queue loops polled every half-second, so no
connection ever sat idle long enough to close, and an unused tenant held two
PostgreSQL backends indefinitely. And the allocator keeps what a burst grew:
a tenant that has once served load stays at roughly 40 MiB, so capacity has to
be planned on that figure, not on a freshly started process.

Latency under load, spread evenly over every tenant:

| Tenants | 200 req/s p95 | 800 req/s p95 | 1,600 req/s p95 |
| ------: | ------------: | ------------: | --------------: |
|      10 |        6.8 ms |        7.3 ms |          150 ms |
|      50 |        8.0 ms |        7.4 ms |           91 ms |
|     100 |        9.7 ms |        6.5 ms |           35 ms |
|     200 |       10.1 ms |        9.0 ms |           75 ms |
|     300 |       10.0 ms |      4,608 ms |        2,540 ms |

A request costs about 1.95 ms of CPU across eunha and PostgreSQL together, so
800 req/s occupies roughly one and a half of ten cores. The collapse at 300
tenants is therefore not a shortage of CPU: eunha's CPU per request doubled
while most cores stayed idle, which points at scheduling 3,600 threads, or at
memory compression on a machine already short of memory, rather than at work.


Quiet queues
------------

The durable queues — deliveries, inbound activities, media — were polled every
half-second to two seconds whether or not anything could be waiting. Every job
is enqueued by a request the same process serves, so the loops now sleep until
that request wakes them, and otherwise back off to
`[workers] queue_idle_poll_seconds` (30 by default), which only bounds how late
a retry that has come due, or a job another process enqueued, is picked up.

With every other setting unchanged:

| Idle                              |          Before | After |
| --------------------------------- | --------------: | ----: |
| Transactions per tenant           |           3.1/s | 0.2/s |
| eunha CPU, 300 tenants            | 12.1% of a core |  0.8% |
| PostgreSQL CPU, 300 tenants       | 13.6% of a core |  4.8% |
| PostgreSQL connections per tenant |               2 |     2 |

The connections stay because a 30-second poll never lets a 60-second idle
timeout expire. That matters more than the baseline suggested: a connection
costs 4.8 MiB privately when fresh, but **19–24 MiB once it has served the
query mix**, as PostgreSQL keeps catalog caches and prepared statements for
the life of the backend. Two warm connections cost a tenant as much memory as
its eunha process does.

Load behaved as before, and 300 tenants at 800 req/s held a p95 of 8.2 ms. The
baseline's collapse at that point did not recur — nor did it when the baseline
binary was run again (p95 14.5 ms). It was the workstation, not eunha, and the
400-tenant run below shows what the workstation was running out of.


Hosting profile
---------------

Quiet queues stop the polling, but a 60-second idle timeout still outlives the
periodic tasks that run every minute, and every process still starts one Tokio
worker per core. The profile changes configuration only:

~~~~ toml
[database_pool]
idle_timeout_seconds = 20

[workers]
queue_idle_poll_seconds = 300
~~~~

with `TOKIO_WORKER_THREADS=2` in the environment.

| Idle, per tenant                        | Quiet queues | Hosting profile |
| --------------------------------------- | -----------: | --------------: |
| Threads                                 |           12 |               4 |
| PostgreSQL connections held, on average |            2 |            1.35 |
| PostgreSQL private memory               |    38–47 MiB |     about 7 MiB |
| New connections                         |         none |      2 a minute |
| Transactions                            |        0.2/s |           0.2/s |

The memory is the point. Connections are closed before they accumulate caches,
so a sampled connection stays at 4–5 MiB instead of 19–24 MiB. They did not
reach zero: the scheduled-status and poll-expiry tasks both ran every minute,
on two connections at once, and sqlx closes idle connections on a 20-second
cycle, so each was open for 20–40 seconds of every minute — until those tasks
were changed, below.

p95 latency at 200 and 800 req/s:

| Tenants |  Quiet queues | Hosting profile |
| ------: | ------------: | --------------: |
|      10 | 7.1 / 15.6 ms |    7.0 / 5.4 ms |
|     100 | 12.2 / 8.6 ms |   10.0 / 5.7 ms |
|     300 | 14.8 / 8.2 ms |  21.8 / 10.6 ms |
|     400 |       not run | 36.9 / 3,934 ms |

Up to 300 tenants the two are indistinguishable within this machine's noise.
At 400 the host collapsed at 800 req/s while decompressing 207,000 pages a
second: the workstation, already using most of its 24 GiB for other work, had
no memory left to keep 400 tenants resident, and every request to one whose
pages had been compressed waited for them. Memory, not CPU or connections, was
the ceiling, and the baseline's earlier collapse at 300 tenants — before the
harness recorded decompression — fits the same explanation.


Timed tasks
-----------

What kept those connections open was three timed tasks — scheduled statuses,
poll expiry and suspended account cleanup — which ran every minute or two
whether or not anything was due. Each now sleeps until its next item falls due
and, when nothing is, for `queue_idle_poll_seconds`, and is woken early when a
schedule or a poll is created or moved.

With the hosting profile, 100 tenants were left idle for eleven minutes and then
sampled every two seconds for ten:

| Idle, per tenant                        |     Before |        After |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------: | -----------: |
| PostgreSQL connections held, on average |       1.35 |         0.33 |
| New connections                         | 2 a minute | 0.8 a minute |
| Transactions                            |      0.2/s |       0.13/s |

Two things nearly made this measurement wrong, and both apply to any idle figure
taken with a long poll. An idle tenant's cost is periodic: with a 300-second
poll, a one-minute window can fall between two rounds of wake-ups and report
nothing at all, which is what the first attempt did. And tenants started
together wake together: the peak was 200 connections, every tenant's whole
pool at once, which is also what a host restart does to real tenants.


Waking tenants
--------------

A tenant started alone answers its first request in 145 ms. Started together:

| Burst | All answering |      Median |
| ----: | ------------: | ----------: |
|    10 |   0.45–0.49 s | 0.44–0.49 s |
|    50 |     1.9–2.0 s |   1.8–1.9 s |
|   100 |     3.7–3.8 s |   3.6–3.7 s |

None failed. Scale-to-zero is practical, but a host waking tenants after an
outage or a deploy should admit a bounded number of starts at a time rather
than all of them.


What one Mac mini holds
-----------------------

Memory decides it. Per tenant, from the runs above, for a process per tenant:

| Tenant                                        |     eunha | PostgreSQL |   Total |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------: | ---------: | ------: |
| Idle, never busy (hosting profile)            | 12–14 MiB |     ~2 MiB | ~16 MiB |
| Idle after serving load (hosting profile)[^1] |   ~40 MiB |     ~2 MiB | ~42 MiB |
| Warm, default settings                        |   ~40 MiB |  38–47 MiB | ~85 MiB |

PostgreSQL's share is a third of a connection on average at 4–5 MiB each, since
the timed tasks stopped waking every minute; it was 7 MiB before.

Planning on ~42 MiB — every tenant has at some point been busy — and setting
aside macOS and services (4 GiB), `shared_buffers`, and page cache and Redis:

| Host memory |     Set aside | For tenants | Tenants at 42 MiB | At 85 MiB |
| ----------: | ------------: | ----------: | ----------------: | --------: |
|      16 GiB | 4 + 2 + 2 GiB |       8 GiB |              ~190 |       ~95 |
|      32 GiB | 4 + 4 + 4 GiB |      20 GiB |              ~490 |      ~240 |
|      64 GiB | 4 + 8 + 8 GiB |      44 GiB |            ~1,070 |      ~530 |

Those are ceilings; plan steady state at 70–80% of them. One process for many
tenants would raise them several times over (see “One process for many
tenants”). At these counts the other resources do not bind first:

 -  **CPU.** A request costs 1.5–2 ms of CPU across eunha and PostgreSQL. Ten
    cores at half utilisation serve roughly 2,500–3,000 req/s, which for 490
    tenants is 5 req/s each at peak — far more than a small instance's clients
    make.
 -  **Connections.** 490 idle tenants hold about 160 connections on average, but
    tenants that wake together — after a host restart — briefly open their whole
    pools, and 490 two-connection pools is 980. `max_connections = 1000` only
    just covers that; spread the wake-ups, or put PgBouncer in front, well
    before then.
 -  **Threads.** Four per tenant is about 2,000 at 490, against a macOS
    host-wide limit of 30,720.
 -  **Disk.** An empty tenant database is 15 MiB. Real ones grow with federated
    content, which this benchmark does not model.

[^1]: Measured on tenants that had served the whole baseline sequence, with a
      worker per core. One tenant profiled after a single 30-second burst kept
      15–31 MiB whatever its worker count (see “Where a tenant's memory goes”),
      so ~40 MiB is a conservative figure to plan on.


Where a tenant's memory goes
----------------------------

Profiled with macOS's own tools — `MallocStackLogging` set on the eunha
process, then `heap`, `vmmap` and `malloc_history` — so without changing a
line of eunha. One tenant in the hosting profile, fresh and after 30 seconds at
160 req/s, across 16 runs:

|                                  |   Fresh | After load |
| -------------------------------- | ------: | ---------: |
| Footprint                        |  14 MiB |  15–31 MiB |
| Live allocations                 | 3.4 MiB |    3.4 MiB |
| Fragmentation in the malloc zone |  ~6 MiB | 7.5–22 MiB |

The live 3.4 MiB is mostly startup state that every process repeats: 1.4 MiB
for the router — 594 routes, each with its middleware layers cloned — about
0.3 MiB of root certificates, and 0.2 MiB for the S3 client. What belongs to
the tenant itself, its pool, Redis connection and configuration, is about
0.3 MiB. A burst of load leaves 35 KiB of new live data behind.

Of those, the router is now built once for the whole process rather than once
per instance, and what that saves was measured the same way as everything else
here: one process serving the same tenants, under the binary before the change
and the binary after it. Its harness and results are in
`benchmark-results/router-20260912/`.

| One process, idle           | 10 tenants | 50 tenants | Per tenant |
| --------------------------- | ---------: | ---------: | ---------: |
| A router for every instance |   37.0 MiB |  144.0 MiB |   2.68 MiB |
| One router for the process  |   14.0 MiB |   27.0 MiB |   0.33 MiB |

The per-tenant column is the slope between the two sizes, not footprint divided
by tenants, which would bury it under the ~10.5 MiB a process pays once however
many tenants it serves — both builds pay that, and both run 12 threads. So a
tenant's own router cost about 2.35 MiB of footprint, rather more than the
1.4 MiB of live allocations above: footprint counts the pages those allocations
sit on, not the bytes. At 50 tenants that is 117 MiB the process no longer
needs, and it is what stops the routes from being the thing that limits how
many tenants a process can hold.

Read the absolute numbers only against each other. These tenants have no data
and serve no requests, with pools of two connections, measured 30 seconds after
every tenant answered — so they cost less per tenant than the 3 MiB the
prototype measured under load with seeded databases. Both builds served the
same tenants alternately, twice over at each size, and repeated to the tenth of
a MiB.

The certificates and the S3 client are still each instance's own.

Everything else is fragmentation: freed space scattered across pages that each
still hold something live, which the allocator cannot hand back. It is
bimodal — a process either settles near 15 MiB or keeps 20–31 MiB — and does
not follow the number of Tokio workers: with one worker a tenant kept 29 MiB
twice, and with ten it never settled below 24 MiB. `malloc_zone_pressure_relief`
released nothing on any call. Latency was the same whichever way a run went.

Two consequences. A process per tenant pays about 10 MiB that one shared
process would pay once — router, certificates, the binary's dirty data pages,
stacks and allocator metadata — before any fragmentation. And the
fragmentation, the larger and less predictable part, is the allocator's rather
than eunha's.

### Allocators

For comparison, eunha was built with jemalloc (`tikv-jemallocator`) and with
mimalloc as its global allocator. Neither is kept; the system allocator is what
eunha uses. Same profile, at each allocator's default settings:

| Allocator               | Runs |  Fresh | After load | Two minutes later |        p95 |
| ----------------------- | ---: | -----: | ---------: | ----------------: | ---------: |
| System                  |    4 | 14 MiB |  25–35 MiB |         25–31 MiB |  7.7–13 ms |
| jemalloc 5.3.1          |    3 | 16 MiB |  29–35 MiB |         23–35 MiB | 7.5–7.9 ms |
| mimalloc (crate 0.1.52) |    3 | 16 MiB |  35–48 MiB |         20–36 MiB | 8.0–9.0 ms |

At their defaults neither does better than the system allocator once the load
has passed, and both start 2 MiB larger. Both return memory lazily — on later
allocations rather than on a clock of their own — so a process that goes quiet
keeps most of what it had; jemalloc gave memory back in one run of three,
mimalloc in all three but from a higher peak.


One process for many tenants
----------------------------

Whether sharing a process is worth building was measured rather than argued,
with a throwaway prototype: a binary that loads many tenants' configurations
into one process, each with its own database pool, Redis namespace,
application state, background tasks and listening port, on one Tokio runtime.
It is not a working multi-tenant server — it routes by port rather than by
`Host`, and the process-wide statics keep the first tenant's domain — but what
it costs to run is what a real one would cost. Its source, harness and results
are kept outside the repository, in `benchmark-results/modes-20260911/`.

The same tenants, configuration (the hosting profile) and load, each run from a
fresh start:

| eunha, per tenant           | Separate ×100 |   Shared ×100 |  Separate ×300 |   Shared ×300 |    Shared ×600 |

At 300 tenants eunha needed 4.7 GiB as separate processes and under 1 GiB as
one, and 600 tenants in one process needed 2 GiB. The shared process also spent
about a quarter less CPU on the same load. Its one bad number, shared ×100 at
800 req/s, came with CPU far from saturated and did not recur at 300 or 600
tenants; it reads as the workstation, but it happened once and is not
explained.

A saturated tenant did not slow its neighbours in either mode. With one tenant
sent 1,200 req/s while the rest shared 100, its own requests queued for seconds
behind its two connections, and the others' p95 stayed at 9–22 ms — faster, in
fact, than when measured alone just before, because that run found their
connections closed and had to open them again.

What limits the shared process is PostgreSQL. From 300 to 600 tenants its CPU at
800 req/s went from 119% to 251% of a core, more than three times eunha's, and
latency rose with it: 600 databases on one server, not 600 tenants in one
process.

With the timed-task change, then, an idle tenant in a shared process costs about
3 MiB of eunha and a third of a connection, against about 42 MiB as its own
process after serving load. On memory alone a 32 GiB Mac mini would hold
several thousand; that is not a number to plan on until PostgreSQL has been
measured holding that many databases.


Ways to scale further
---------------------

In order of what the measurements say they are worth:

1.  **One process for many tenants.** Measured with a prototype: about 3 MiB of
    eunha per tenant instead of 12–16, twelve threads for the whole process, a
    seventh of the startup time, and no slowdown from a saturated neighbour. It
    pays for fragmentation once, where a different allocator did not recover it
    (see “Allocators”). It needs the refactor and controls in phase 4 of
    [MULTITENANCY.md](./MULTITENANCY.md), and PostgreSQL becomes the limit.
2.  **Spread idle wake-ups.** Tenants started together wake together every
    `queue_idle_poll_seconds` and open their whole pools at once. A little
    random jitter on each sleep would turn that spike into a steady trickle.
3.  **Dormancy.** A dormant tenant costs its database on disk and nothing else,
    and wakes in 145 ms. It needs the gateway and shared workers described in
    [MULTITENANCY.md](./MULTITENANCY.md), and an admission limit on concurrent
    wakes.
4.  **PgBouncer** once connections approach `max_connections`, in transaction
    mode with prepared statements verified against SQLx.
5.  **PostgreSQL on its own machine.** On one Mac mini it competes with tenants
    for the same memory, and with tenants sharing a process it is where the CPU
    goes: at 600 tenants it used more than three times eunha's. Separating them
    gives both room, at the cost of a network hop on every query, which should
    be measured.
6.  **More machines,** placing tenants by measured memory rather than by count.


Not yet measured
----------------

 -  **Federation.** Inbound activities (signature verification, fetching remote
    actors) and outbound delivery fan-out are likely the largest CPU cost of a
    well-connected instance, and none of this load includes them.
 -  **Media.** Image decoding and blurhash are CPU-bound and bursty.
 -  **Streaming.** What each open WebSocket costs.
 -  **Real data.** Every database here was empty.
 -  **Dedicated hardware.** Every number was taken on a developer workstation
    already using most of its memory. Run the script on the machine that will
    serve tenants before sizing a fleet from it.
