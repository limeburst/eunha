Eunha
=====

Rust re-implementation of Mastodon.

Eunha aims for 100% Mastodon database schema compatibility, so that Eunha can
be a drop-in replacement on top of your existing Mastodon database.

We track the latest Mastodon release, and provide migration path from old Eunha
database schema to updated Mastodon database schema.

It's not Eunha's goal to completely mimic Mastodon's feature set or its
implementation detail, and Eunha may contain behavioral differences.
