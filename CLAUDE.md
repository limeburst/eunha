Eunha
=====

Rust re-implementation of Mastodon. Eunha aims for 100% Mastodon database
schema compatibility, so that it can be a drop-in replacement on top of an
existing Mastodon database. It tracks the latest Mastodon release; behavioural
differences are allowed, but each one is either a bug or a recorded decision.

The documentation is in *docs/*, a VitePress site published at
<https://eunha.social/docs/>. Read the page for the area you are working in
before changing it, and update it in the same commit when behaviour changes.


Rules
-----

 -  All Mastodon tables go in the `public` schema; tables only eunha needs go
    in the `eunha` schema.
 -  Use mise for all tasks. See *mise.toml*.
 -  Use the [shadcn/ui] CLI when adding frontend components. Don't hand-roll
    components.
 -  For all federation work, use [feder], and extend it when necessary.
 -  Start tasks with `tenants::spawn` and `tenants::spawn_blocking`, never
    `tokio::spawn` or `spawn_blocking` directly, so the task keeps its
    `tenant{domain=…}` span. *clippy.toml* enforces this.
 -  Every Redis key eunha owns goes through the configured key prefix. A new
    Redis command must be added to the ACL list in
    *docs/operating/redis.md*, because tenant users are granted only those.
 -  Migrations are applied by `eunha migrate`, never by starting the server.
 -  A deliberate difference from Mastodon gets an entry in *divergences.toml*,
    which `cargo test` checks.
 -  Run `mise run fmt:check` before committing. It covers Rust and every
    Markdown file, *docs/* included.
 -  Run `mise run docs:build` after editing *docs/*; it fails on dead links.

Where things are documented
---------------------------

Running an instance:

 -  *docs/operating/first-account.md*: `eunha accounts create`.
 -  *docs/operating/migrations.md*: `eunha migrate` and the startup check.
 -  *docs/operating/redis.md*: key prefixes, ACLs, the coordination pool.
 -  *docs/operating/instances.md*: several instances in one process, the
    tenants directory, admission limits, `SIGHUP` reload, host aliases, and
    shared media buckets.
 -  *docs/operating/invites.md*: the everyone role and handing out invites.
 -  *docs/operating/update-notices.md*: the optional update check.

Tracking Mastodon:

 -  *docs/mastodon/tracking.md*: `mastodon.toml`, `eunha-schema`, the schema
    check, and the steps for adopting a new Mastodon release.
 -  *docs/mastodon/signing-keys.md* and *docs/mastodon/http-signatures.md*.
 -  *docs/mastodon/entity-parity.md*, *docs/mastodon/differential-testing.md*
    and *docs/mastodon/federation-testing.md*: the harnesses that compare
    eunha with upstream, and the environment traps that fake failures.
 -  *docs/mastodon/divergences.md*: how *divergences.toml* works.
 -  *docs/mastodon/4.7.1.md*: what the tracked release changed.
