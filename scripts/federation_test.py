"""Federate eunha with a real Mastodon, in both directions, and check what lands.

The rest of this repo's federation tests run eunha against eunha. Both sides
then share eunha's reading of ActivityPub, so a misreading is invisible: two
servers agreeing about something they are both wrong about looks exactly like
correctness. This drives the same activities between eunha and Mastodon 4.7.0,
where nothing is shared but the specification.

Each case makes something happen through one server's own API — so the activity
is signed, addressed and delivered by that server's real code — and then asks
the other server what it received. Delivery is asynchronous on both sides, so
every check polls.

Run it through scripts/federation_test.sh, which builds the pair.

Known state, as of writing: all twenty-four checks pass. A follow, a status, a
favourite, a boost and a delete cross in both directions and are understood on
the other side.

One note on eunha's delivery, visible in the proxy log: each POST is a 401 then
a 202. That is the double-knock working as intended — draft-cavage first, then
RFC 9421 when the peer answers 401 — and is what Mastodon 4.7 itself does. It
reads alarmingly in an access log and is not a failure.

Six things about the environment took a while to find, and all five make a
correct implementation look broken:

* **Port 443 or nothing.** Mastodon webfingers an account by the *host* of its
  actor URI and drops the port, so eunha on `:3002` is looked up on `:443` and
  every delivery fails verification. eunha sits behind a proxy on 443 for this
  reason, not by preference.
* **A private address is refused by both.** Mastodon has `ALLOWED_PRIVATE_
  ADDRESSES` for it; eunha's `PublicOnlyResolver` has no equivalent, so remote
  actors are seeded rather than fetched.
* **The image runs as a non-root user**, so the CA goes in through
  `SSL_CERT_FILE` — appended to the image's own bundle, not replacing it.
* **No Sidekiq means nothing is delivered at all**, silently.
* **`ALLOWED_PRIVATE_ADDRESSES` belongs on the sidekiq service, not just web.**
  Deliveries run in sidekiq; without it every one fails before a request is
  made, and Mastodon's circuit breaker then trips the inbox to red and stops
  trying. The symptom is no request, no error, and empty queues — which reads as
  "Mastodon silently refuses to talk to eunha" and is nothing of the kind. If
  deliveries stop arriving, look for `stoplight:` keys in Mastodon's Redis
  before suspecting eunha.
* **Mastodon cannot search statuses without Elasticsearch.** Asking `/api/v2/
  search` whether a status arrived answers no whatever the truth, so the check
  reads the account's timeline instead. This one cost the most: it looked for a
  long time like eunha was not delivering, when eunha was delivering and
  Mastodon was storing it perfectly well.
