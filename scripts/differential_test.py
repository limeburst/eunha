"""Compare eunha's API responses against a live Mastodon's.

The other checks in this repo compare eunha to a *reading* of Mastodon — its
serializers, its callbacks, its scopes. This one asks Mastodon itself: the same
request goes to both servers, and the two responses are compared field by field.
A rule misread while writing a test is a rule wrong in the test too; this cannot
make that mistake, because nothing here encodes what the answer should be.

Two things are compared. **Shape** — which fields exist and what kind each holds
— everywhere, because ids, hostnames, timestamps and tokens necessarily differ
between two servers and asking them to agree would drown the signal. And
**values**, but only for fields where two servers genuinely should agree: the
constants and limits an instance advertises about itself, listed in
`COMPARED_VALUES` below.

That second part exists because the first was not enough. eunha advertised
`max_display_name_length: 30` where Mastodon says 40 — so a client would have
refused a display name this server accepts — and a shape comparison passed it,
both being integers.

Usage:
    scripts/differential_test.py --eunha http://localhost:3001 \
                                 --mastodon http://localhost:3000 \
                                 --eunha-token TOKEN --mastodon-token TOKEN
