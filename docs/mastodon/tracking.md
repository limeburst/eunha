Tracking Mastodon
=================

The Mastodon release eunha implements is recorded in `mastodon.toml` and
repeated as build metadata in `Cargo.toml`'s version, which `build.rs` checks
the two agree on. Releases are tagged the same way:

~~~~
v0.2.0+mastodon.4.7.1
~~~~

Eunha's own version moves independently; the part after `+` names the Mastodon
release whose schema and API that build implements, and is what
`/api/v1/instance`, `/api/v2/instance` and NodeInfo report.

`eunha-schema` (`mise run mastodon:status`, `mastodon:plan`, `schema:check`)
does the tracking:

~~~~
mise run mastodon:status                 # is there a newer Mastodon release?
mise run mastodon:plan --to v4.8.0       # what would adopting it involve?
mise run schema:check                    # does this database match the target?
~~~~

`schema:check` reads the live database back out of Postgres and compares it
against a **reference**: the structure of a database that Mastodon's own
ActiveRecord built from its `db/schema.rb`. Comparing Postgres to Postgres means
comparing everything Postgres knows — tables, column types, nullability and
defaults, the columns an index actually covers, every constraint *by name* as
well as by definition, sequences, and view definitions — rather than what a
parser of ours believes a Ruby file means. It is the test for the
100%-compatibility claim, and it runs on every `cargo test`.

Two things are deliberately not compared, because they record how a database
came to be rather than what it is, and `schema.rb` cannot express either:

 -  **Sequences left behind by dropped tables.** Mastodon creates one sequence
    per snowflake-id table by hand, so nothing owns it and dropping the table
    leaves it behind — `encrypted_messages_id_seq` has outlived its table since
    2022. Every Mastodon that migrated through that period has it; one
    installed fresh today does not. Eunha matches the former, because that is
    what it stands in for. A sequence whose table *does* exist, or one the
    reference has and the database lacks, is still reported.
 -  **Sequence ownership.** `quotes` was created with a serial id and later
    moved to `timestamp_id`, so a migrated Mastodon owns that sequence and a
    freshly loaded one does not.

Three files under `mastodon/` support it, all regenerated together by
`mise run schema:build-reference`:

 -  `schema.rb` — upstream's own file, vendored verbatim.
 -  `schema.sql` — a `pg_dump` of a database built from it, for reading and
    diffing.
 -  `schema.json` — the same database's structure as the checker sees it, which
    is what the test compares against so that it needs neither Ruby nor a
    database of its own.

Building the reference runs Mastodon's `schema.rb` through the real ActiveRecord
schema DSL. That needs Ruby, but not Mastodon: `activerecord` and `pg`, not its
thousand-gem bundle.


Adopting a release
------------------

1.  `mise run mastodon:plan --to vX.Y.Z` lists the Rails migrations upstream
    added since the tracked release, and the deliberate divergences that now
    need re-examining against it.

2.  Write one eunha migration reproducing them, ending with an
    `INSERT INTO public.schema_migrations` of the versions it covers — a
    migration eunha deliberately does not implement is left out of that list, so
    that a Mastodon booted on the database still runs it. `--sql` prints the
    insert.

3.  Update `mastodon.toml` and `Cargo.toml`, replace `mastodon/schema.rb` with
    that release's, and run `mise run schema:build-reference`. The reference's
    diff is the schema delta you are adopting.

4.  Re-examine each divergence and move its `reviewed_for` forward in
    `divergences.toml`; the suite fails until every entry has been looked at.

5.  `mise run schema:check` against a database that has run the new migration.

6.  Rehearse it against real data before deploying. An instance gets one attempt
    at a migration:

    ~~~~
    scripts/rehearse_migration.sh postgres://user@localhost/seoul_earth
    ~~~~

    That clones the database (reading only), runs the pending migrations over
    the clone as the server would, and reports every table whose row count
    changed plus the schema check. Anything that moves rows it should not is
    visible there rather than in production.
