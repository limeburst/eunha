Deliberate divergences
======================

Eunha aims for behavioural parity, so a difference from Mastodon is either a bug
or a decision. The decisions live in `divergences.toml`, one entry each, saying
what Mastodon does, what eunha does instead, why, and which test would fail if
that stopped being true.

They are recorded as data rather than prose because prose is not checked and so
stops being true. `cargo test` reads that file: an entry whose evidence has gone
missing fails, and — the part that matters over time — every entry carries the
Mastodon release it was last judged against, so **adopting a newer release fails
the suite until each divergence has been re-examined**. A divergence that made
sense against one release is not automatically right against the next; upstream
may have adopted the same idea, changed what is being diverged from, or ruled it
out. `mise run mastodon:plan` prints them when adopting, so the question is
asked at the moment it can be answered.

At the time of writing there are seven, covering integrity proofs on outgoing
activities, the invite tree and the two ways eunha's invite API goes beyond
Mastodon's, what the update check asks about, when the local-keypair migration
is recorded, and what a mute silences. Read the file rather than this paragraph:
the file is the one that has to stay true.
