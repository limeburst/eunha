All Mastodon tables should go in the `public` schema, while tables needed for
Eunha goes in the `eunha` schema.

Use mise for all tasks. See `mise.toml`.

Use [shadcn/ui] CLI when adding components. Don't hand-roll components.

Federation
----------

For all federation related tasks, we use [feder], and extend it when necessary.

The extension eunha designs for the places ActivityPub scales badly is recorded
in [the protocol extension](../design/protocol.md): the dereference storm a
boost sets off, the absence of backfill, and identity that cannot outlive a
hostname. It is a design record rather than a description of what eunha does
today, and it says which is which.
