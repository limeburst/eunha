Shared Redis
============

Eunha uses unprefixed Redis keys by default, which is appropriate when an
instance has a dedicated Redis process. A pooled deployment must give every
instance a unique prefix and a Redis user restricted to that prefix:

~~~~ toml
redis_url = "redis://tenant-example:password@redis-pool:6379/0"
redis_key_prefix = "tenant-example"
~~~~

The prefix may contain ASCII letters, digits, hyphens and underscores. Eunha
adds the separating colon, so the ACL key pattern for the example is
`~tenant-example:*`. Every Redis key Eunha owns — feeds, feed population
markers, ActivityPub locks and tombstones, posting idempotency, and notification
group state — uses that namespace.

Do not treat a prefix as authorization. Give each instance a distinct Redis
user, the matching key pattern, and only the commands Eunha uses:

~~~~
+get +set +setex +exists +fcall +zadd +zremrangebyrank +zrem
+zrangebyscore +zrevrangebyscore +mget +del
~~~~

The hosting provisioner installs the fixed `eunha_compare_delete` function used
for lock release. Tenant users receive `FCALL`, but not `EVAL`, `EVALSHA`,
`SCRIPT` or `FUNCTION`, so a compromised credential cannot submit arbitrary Lua
to the shared event loop. Dedicated Redis remains zero-configuration: Eunha
falls back to its existing inline script when the named function is absent.
`INFO` is optional; without it the admin API reports the Redis version as
unknown. Process-wide memory from `INFO memory` is never exposed when a key
prefix is configured. Set `redis_process_metrics = false` to suppress it for an
otherwise dedicated deployment as well.

ACLs do not isolate CPU, memory, eviction or persistence. A shared pool remains
one performance and failure boundary and needs monitoring, bounded feed
retention, admission controls, and a path for moving heavy tenants to dedicated
Redis.

Feeds and their population markers use `redis_url`; they are bounded cache
state. Set `redis_coordination_url` to route locks, ActivityPub deletion
tombstones, posting idempotency and notification grouping to a separate
non-evicting Redis pool. If it is absent, both classes use `redis_url` as they
did before this option existed. Both endpoints use the same `redis_key_prefix`
and tenant credentials may differ by embedding them in their respective URLs.
Process-wide memory is omitted from tenant-facing admin responses whenever a
prefix or separate coordination endpoint is configured.
