Update notices
==============

Mastodon polls an update server for newer releases and for the end of support
of the branch it runs, and records both in `software_updates` and
`software_deprecations`. Eunha asks the same server the same question about the
Mastodon release *it implements*: eunha builds 4.7.1's schema and serves its
API, so when that branch stops receiving fixes, what eunha reproduces is what
is going out of support.

Eunha asks nobody anything unless `software_update_url` names a server, which
nothing does by default. Nothing in eunha reads the notices back: they are
recorded for a Mastodon that may later boot on the database, and mailed to the
instance's own administrators — who on a hosted instance cannot act on them,
because only whoever runs the binary can take a release up. Operators who want
the end-of-support warning name the server:

~~~~ toml
software_update_url = "https://api.joinmastodon.org/update-check"
~~~~

The request then carries the Mastodon version being asked about and eunha's own
`User-Agent`; it does not claim to be Mastodon. A process asks once however
many instances it serves — the question is about the release the binary
implements, so it is the same for all of them — and records the answer in each
of their databases. Instances naming different servers are asked separately,
and the set is read afresh each time, so a reload's arrivals and departures are
picked up. Whoever tracks releases for a fleet is better served by
`mise run mastodon:status`.
