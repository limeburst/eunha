//! Handing invites to somebody else.
//!
//! Mastodon has no equivalent. There an invite is made by the person who will
//! hand it out, and `invite_users` is the whole of the question — either a
//! member may make as many as they like, or none at all. An instance that wants
//! to say "you may bring two people" has nothing to say it with.
//!
//! So an admin here mints the codes *into the member's own account*: they
//! appear on that member's invite page for them to pass on, and whoever signs
//! up through one lands under **them** in the invite tree rather than under the
//! admin who minted it. The count is the limit — there is no allowance to keep
//! books on, because the codes themselves are the allowance.
