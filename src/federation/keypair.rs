//! Local accounts' signing keys.
//!
//! Mastodon 4.7.0 moved them out of `accounts.private_key` / `public_key` and
//! into the `keypairs` table, one row per key with a `local_fragment` naming
//! the key inside the actor document (`#main-key`), and the private half
//! encrypted at rest. The old columns stay readable — upstream's
//! `Keypair.from_legacy_account` still falls back to them — so a database can
//! be in either state, and eunha reads both.
//!
//! Writing the new form needs the encryption keys Mastodon requires
//! (`ACTIVE_RECORD_ENCRYPTION_PRIMARY_KEY` and `_KEY_DERIVATION_SALT`), because
//! a private key eunha wrote in the clear is one a Mastodon pointed at the same
//! database could not read. Without them configured, eunha keeps using the
//! legacy columns, which both implementations still understand.
