//! One process, any number of instances.
//!
//! Every eunha process serves a registry of tenants — an instance each, with
//! its own configuration, database pool, Redis namespace and background tasks
//! — and hands every request to one of them by its `Host` header before
//! anything else sees it. A single instance is a registry of one, read from
//! `config.toml` and the environment as it always was; `--tenants <dir>` reads
//! one configuration file per instance from a directory.
//!
//! What is per tenant is everything a request or a background task touches.
//! What is per process is what the listener, the SSRF-guarded resolver and the
//! shared budget of outbound deliveries impose: the address to listen on, the
//! private networks federation may reach, and how many deliveries may be in
//! flight. Tenants in one directory must agree on those, and the process
//! refuses to start when they do not.
//!
//! Sharing a process also means sharing its capacity. Among several tenants
//! each has a limit on requests in flight, past which its requests are shed
//! with 503 rather than queued, so one being flooded cannot slow the others.
//!
//! And a process takes on only what it can hold. It refuses to start with more
//! tenants than its ceiling, which is how many one crash may take down, or with
//! database pools that could open more connections than their PostgreSQL
//! server accepts — a budget that, overrun, fails whichever tenant happens to
//! ask last rather than failing the configuration at startup.
//!
//! Everything a tenant does runs in its [`span`], so every line logged names
//! the instance it was for. Tasks keep it through [`spawn`] and
//! [`spawn_blocking`]; `clippy.toml` refuses Tokio's own, which would start
//! them outside every span.
//!
//! The routes are the process's own rather than each tenant's, built once by
//! [`crate::build_app`]: the dispatcher puts the tenant's state on the request
//! instead, and handlers take it as a plain `AppState` extractor. A router of
//! 594 routes with their layers cost about 1.4 MiB for every tenant that had
//! one of its own.
//!
//! A running process can be handed a new set of tenants with
//! [`Tenants::reload`] — `eunha` does so on `SIGHUP` — which starts, restarts
//! and stops only the tenants that changed, while the rest serve on.
