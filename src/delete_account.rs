//! Account deletion — a port of Mastodon's `DeleteAccountService`
//! (`app/services/delete_account_service.rb`) together with the `Account#suspend!`
//! / `Account#unsuspend!` model methods it builds on.
//!
//! Suspend or remove an account and remove as much of its data as possible. If
//! it is a local account that has not been confirmed or never been approved,
//! side effects are skipped and both the user and account records are removed
//! fully. Otherwise, behaviour is controlled by [`Options`]:
//!
//! | caller                       | reserve_username | reserve_email |
//! |------------------------------|------------------|---------------|
//! | self-service delete          | yes              | no            |
//! | admin delete / 30-day purge  | yes              | yes           |
//! | admin reject (pending user)  | no               | no            |
//! | inbound `Delete(actor)`      | no               | (remote)      |
//!
//! Two deliberate departures from Mastodon, both noted at their call sites:
//!
//! * Invite lineage is snapshotted into `eunha.invite_lineage` before the user
//!   row (which carries the email and the rest of the PII) is destroyed, so
//!   eunha's invite tree survives a deletion that removes the personal data.
//! * Counter caches on *other* accounts' statuses (replies/reblogs/quotes) are
//!   decremented. Mastodon's batched removal path skips its callbacks and
//!   leaves them stale; eunha keeps them accurate, as its single-status delete
//!   already does.
