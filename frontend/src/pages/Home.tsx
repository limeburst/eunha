// Signed out there is no home timeline, and what a visitor arrived to look at
// is the instance's own posts — so "/" is the local timeline rather than a
// paragraph about the software running it. What the instance says about itself
// still has a page of its own at /about.
//
// A dispatcher rather than a branch inside the timeline: signing in or out
// reloads the page, so the two never swap under a mounted component, and each
// keeps its own hooks. The advanced layout joins it on the same terms.
//
// A narrow screen overrides the preference rather than consulting it. The
// advanced layout is a row of 24rem panes that scrolls sideways, which on a
// phone is one column you cannot see the edges of and a second you have to
// swipe the first away to reach — so it is not a worse way to read a phone,
// it is not a way to read a phone. The setting is per browser, so a phone can
// already be left on the single column; this covers the two cases that are
// not a choice anyone made — a desktop browser dragged narrow, and the same
// browser profile syncing its localStorage to a phone.
