/**
 * The heading at the top of a column.
 *
 * Mastodon 5.0 standardised these — the announcement counts "at least 12
 * different headers" before it — and gives each column one bar with the same
 * shape: a title that scrolls the column back to the top when clicked, and
 * room on the right for whatever that page can do.
 *
 * The title is not always the navigation's word for the page. Home is labelled
 * "Following", because that is what the feed *is*; the rail already says where
 * you are.
 *
 * Given a `gripRef`, the whole bar is also the handle its column is dragged
 * by — the bar rather than a separate grip icon, because it is already the
 * part of a column that is not the column's contents, and a handle small
 * enough to need aiming at is a handle people miss. What makes it one is the
 * ref: the sortable listens on whatever element it is given, and marks it up
 * for the keyboard and for screen readers.
